# tv-flicks-app
An Angular4 application that allows you to view tv shows by calling an external api

## Summary:

• Used routing to route to multiple parameters and connected to external api.
• Ported data from external api and customized internally in the application.
• Created custom searching functionality to search for TV shows.
• Send multiple HTTP requests at the same time using Fork Join calls to get full TV show listings of requested TV series



In this application there is a carousel to show the featured shows available.
